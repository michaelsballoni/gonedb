# gonedb
A file-based graph DB library that gives you the power of a graph DB in your Go program;\
No server required, just storage for a single database file.

As far as gonedb goes, being a graph database is nothing fancier than nodes, links between nodes, and properties on nodes and links.\
More background on graph databases can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database).
